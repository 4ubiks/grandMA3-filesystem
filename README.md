# grandMA3 File System Overveiw
The grandMA3 file system is complex and intricate, and I have yet to find decent documentation that outlines the file system. This aims to do that. 

The file is `ma_filesystem_tree.md`, and it's just a breakdown of the entire filesystem. I'll hopefully go through and emphasize more relevant repositories in the future, but for now, I'd just stick with `Ctrl+F` for anything you think you may need. 

## Instructions
To move into directories (any one of the below four works):
<br> `cd [DirectoryName]`
<br> `cd [DirectoryNumber]` 
<br> `ChangeDestination [DirectoryName]`
<br> `ChangeDestination [DirectoryNumber]`

To move out of directories (either command will do the same action):
<br > `cd ..`
<br> `ChangeDestination ..`

To return to User[Fixture]: 
<br> `cd root` 
<br> `ChangeDestination root`

To list contents of the current directory:
<br> `list`
