# grandMA3 File System Overveiw
The grandMA3 file system is complex and intricate, and I have yet to find decent documentation that outlines the file system. This aims to do that. 

I'll have a terminal-style tree output window and a visual created on drawio or something. 

## Instructions
To move into directories (any one of the below four works):
<br> `cd [DirectoryName]`
<br> `cd [DirectoryNumber]` 
<br> `ChangeDestination [DirectoryName]`
<br> `ChangeDestination [DirectoryNumber]`

To move out of directories (either command will do the same action):
<br > `cd ..`
<br> `ChangeDestination ..`

To return to User[Fixture]: 
<br> `cd root` 
<br> `ChangeDestination root`

To list contents of the current directory:
<br> `list`
