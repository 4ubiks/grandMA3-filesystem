# grandMA3 File System Overveiw
The grandMA3 file system is complex and intricate, and I have yet to find decent documentation that outlines the file system. This aims to do that. 

I'll have a terminal-style tree output window and a visual created on drawio or something. 

## Instructions
To move into directories (any one of the below four works):
`cd [DirectoryName]` 
`cd [DirectoryNumber]`
`ChangeDestination [DirectoryName]`
`ChangeDestination [DirectoryNumber]`

To move out of directories (either command will do the same action):
`cd ..`
`ChangeDestination ..`

To list contents of the current directory:
`list`
